## Overview
This project is a Unity-based 3D application designed to showcase various assets, terrains, and interactive elements. It includes a variety of 3D models, animations, and scripts to create an immersive experience. The project structure is organized to facilitate easy navigation and scalability.


## Game Story / Description

The main character of the game is a brave archer girl. She must survive against enemies consisting of robots and zombies. These enemies attack the character by throwing red balls, aiming to reduce her health. At the beginning of the game, the character has 3 lives, and each hit from a red ball causes her to lose one life.

The game takes place in a dark, dimly lit environment dominated by red tones. The level is built as a three-dimensional map filled with stairs and various structures. The player earns points by collecting coins scattered throughout the environment. When the final coin on the staircase is collected, the current scene ends and the player is transported to a new level.

The next level is the Coconut Palm Tree scene. In this area, lighting and camera systems are used dynamically with various techniques. A light attached to the character acts as a flashlight, illuminating the dark surroundings. As the character moves forward, the camera rotates around her, creating a cinematic and immersive experience.
